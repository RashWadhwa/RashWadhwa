## **Aspiring Data Analyst | Building Skills in Data Analysis & Visualization**  
---  
I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual with a strong foundation
in computer science, and a passion for transforming complex data 
into actionable insights. Recently, I completed an intensive Data Skills 
Bootcamp with Just IT Training, where I gained practical experience in 
Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Excel, and Azure. I am eager to apply my 
analytical skills, technical expertise, and business acumen to solve 
real-world challenges, contribute to data-driven decision-making, and 
continue developing my skills in a dynamic environment. 
I am an AI enthusiast and a passionate data analyst who loves statistics and transforming raw data into meaningful insights.
I enjoy working across tools like Excel, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Python, Azure, and AWS to deliver value through reports and dashboards by doing end-to-end projects.
Productive and competent with great attention to detail and multitasking skills.

I'll start this September a Bachelor's degree in Applied Data Science at Harper Adams University, Telford.

🌍  I'm based in Wolverhampton

## **Aspiring Data Analyst | Building Skills in Data Analysis & Visualisation**  
---  
I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual with a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for converting complex data into actionable insights.
Recently, I completed an intensive Data Skills Bootcamp with Just IT Training, where I gained practical experience in Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Excel, and Azure.
I am eager to apply my analytical skills, technical expertise, and business acumen to address real-world challenges, support data-driven decision-making,
and further develop my skills in a dynamic environment.
I am an AI enthusiast and a passionate data analyst who loves statistics and turning raw data into meaningful insights. 
I enjoy working across tools like Excel, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Python, Azure, and AWS to provide value through reports and dashboards by completing end-to-end projects.
Productive and competent, with great attention to detail and strong multitasking skills.

I'll start this September a Bachelor's degree in Applied Data Science at Harper Adams University, Telford.


🌍  I'm based in Wolverhampton

## **About Me**
- I'm an AI enthusiast and a passionate data analyst who loves statistics and transforming raw data into meaningful insights. I enjoy working across tools like Excel, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Python, Azure, and AWS to deliver value through reports and dashboards by doing end-to-end projects. Productive and competent with great attention to detail and multitasking skills.

- I've completed an A-Level in Computer Science with high grades and am currently doing a skilled data technician BootCamp with Just IT.
- I'll start this September a Bachelor's degree in Applied Data Science at Harper Adams University, Telford.

- I am always open to new opportunities and connections in the tech industry. Feel free to reach out! ðŸš€
